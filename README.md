## The Problem

The GTM stack is broken for indie teams and small agencies.

- **Clay costs $800/month.** For a solo founder or 3-person team, that's a serious burn before you have revenue.
- **Apollo has 50M contacts but zero personalization.** Spray-and-pray doesn't work anymore. Buyers tune it out.
- **Writing outreach manually doesn't scale.** You can't research 50 companies per week and write tailored messages for each one by hand.
- **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) is the new SEO and nobody has tools for it.** ChatGPT and Perplexity are replacing Google for discovery queries. Your prospects research vendors in AI search engines before replying to your outreach. If you're invisible there, you lose.

opengtm is the open-source alternative. MIT licensed, runs locally, uses Gemini + Google Search grounding for real data (no hallucinations), and integrates natively with Claude Code.

## Pipeline Overview

```
Lead Generation                         Content & AEO
──────────────────────────────────       ──────────────────────────────
Discover → Research → Qualify           Context → Keywords → Blog
    |           |        |                  |                    |
    v           v        v                  v                    v
Message → Outreach → Sync             Analytics ──────→ AEO Mentions
    |
  CRM (Google Sheets)
```

**Outbound pipeline:** Find companies, extract decision-maker contacts, score ICP fit, generate personalized outreach by pattern (A/B/C/D/E), manage a 4-touch sequence, sync to CRM.

**Content pipeline:** Extract company context, run keyword research (7 stages), generate SEO blog articles (5 stages), run AEO health check (29 checks), measure AI visibility with real queries.

## Quickstart

Three commands to your first qualified lead:

```bash
pip install opengtm

## ICP Scoring

Leads are scored 0-100 across 6 dimensions inferred from website signals. No manual input required — the score is derived automatically from the website audit.

| Dimension | Max pts | What it measures |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Company size | 20 | Blog, social links, site complexity as headcount proxy |
| Industry fit | 25 | Tiered by typical LTV and digital spend |
| Digital maturity | 15 | Blog investment, social presence, schema markup, language consistency |
| Pain signals | 20 | Severity-weighted website audit findings |
| Revenue signals | 10 | Content investment, multiple high-severity issues (budget proxy) |
| Contact quality | 10 | Name + LinkedIn + email found |

Score interpretation:

| Score | Tier | Recommended action |
|-------|------|--------------------|
| 70-100 | **Hot** | Prioritize: connect on LinkedIn this week |
| 45-69 | **Warm** | Standard outreach sequence |
| 0-44 | **Cold** | Long-term nurture pool |

You can override the ICP profile entirely with a custom dict for niche verticals.

## AEO Health Check

**What is AEO?** Answer Engine Optimization is the practice of making your website visible in AI search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude. These tools answer user queries by citing sources — if your site isn't structured for AI crawlers and doesn't have the right schema, you don't appear. AEO is the 2025+ equivalent of SEO.

The health check runs 29 checks across 4 categories and returns a tiered score with grade A+ to F.

| Category | Checks | What it covers |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| AI Crawler Access | 4 | GPTBot (OpenAI), Claude-Web (Anthropic), PerplexityBot, CCBot |
| Structured Data | 6 | Organization schema completeness, FAQ, sameAs links, content freshness |
| Technical SEO | 16 | Title, meta description, H1, heading structure, image alt, viewport, HTTPS, canonical, robots, word count, internal links, language tag, sitemap, response time, hreflang |
| Authority Signals | 3 | About page, contact info, social proof links |

Tiered scoring caps:

| Tier | Condition | Score Cap |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| 0 | Blocks all AI crawlers | 10 |
| 0 | Blocks 3+ AI crawlers | 25 |
| 0 | noindex directive on page | 5 |
| 1 | Missing Organization schema | 45 |
| 1 | Missing title or HTTPS | 55 |
| 2 | Incomplete schema or thin content | 75-95 |

| Grade | Score | Visibility band |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| A+ | 90+ | Excellent |
| A | 80-89 | Strong |
| B | 65-79 | Good |
| C | 45-64 | Moderate |
| D | 25-44 | Weak |
| F | <25 | Critical |

The logic: first, can AI crawlers even access your site? If not, nothing else matters. Second, can AI understand who you are (Organization schema)? Third, is your content structured and readable?

## Message Frameworks

5 pattern categories, selected automatically based on the best audit finding:

| Pattern | Trigger | Example hook |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **A** | Specific finding (meta, title, broken elements, schema) | "I noticed example.com has no meta description. Google shows random text snippets instead. Quick win, 5 minutes of work." |
| **B** | Competitor visible in AI search, you're not | "[Competitor] shows up in ChatGPT for B2B SaaS companies, example.com doesn't yet. I looked at why." |
| **C** | Blog exists but content not indexed | "Your blog isn't being picked up by search engines. The content is there, but it's not surfacing in searches. Usually 1-2 technical fixes." |
| **D** | No strong finding / free tool angle | "Do you know your AI visibility? You can check how example.com ranks in ChatGPT and Perplexity in 60 seconds." |
| **E** | Clean site / no strong finding / fallback | "I tested whether example.com shows up in ChatGPT and Perplexity. Most B2B SaaS companies in Berlin don't yet." |

Every output includes: `connection_note` (LinkedIn request, 280 chars), `first_dm`, `followup`, `followup_2`, `followup_3`, and `alternatives` (other pattern options).

Supports English and German. German output uses DACH-calibrated formal address (Herr/Frau + last name) for Finance, Legal, and Medical verticals.

\* Gemini free tier: 1,500 requests/day. Sufficient for most small teams.

## Use Case Personas

**1. Startup founder** — You're doing 0-to-1 outbound and can't afford Clay. Use opengtm to find 20 qualified B2B leads per week, research decision-makers, write personalized LinkedIn messages, and track your AEO visibility so prospects find you before you reach out.

**2. Growth agency** — Run discovery + research for clients at scale. Automate the research leg, generate message templates per lead, sync to client Google Sheets via webhook. Use the content pipeline to generate SEO content for multiple client domains.

**3. SEO consultant** — Run AEO health checks for client sites, identify schema gaps, check AI crawler access, run keyword research (7 stages), generate content briefs. The 29-check audit gives you a structured deliverable you can hand to a client.

**4. Claude Code power user** — Integrate the full GTM pipeline into your Claude Code workflow. Import any module directly, use the Python API, extend with custom ICP profiles or CRM integrations. Everything is standard Python, no black boxes.

**5. Content marketer** — Use the 5-stage blog pipeline: company context extraction, Gemini + Google Search grounding, content similarity check, URL verification, structured output with HTML + sources. AEO optimization is built into every article.

## FAQ

**How is this different from Clay.run?**
Clay is a closed SaaS that costs $800/month. opengtm is MIT licensed, runs locally, and you pay only for API usage (Gemini free tier covers development). Clay has more integrations; opengtm has AEO health checks, content pipelines, and Claude Code integration that Clay doesn't have.

**Does it work without a Gemini API key?**
The `qualify.py`, `message.py`, `outreach.py`, and `sync.py` modules work without an API key. Discovery, research, context, analytics (AI visibility), blog, and keywords all require Gemini. The AEO health check (29 technical checks) also works without a key — it fetches and parses the HTML locally.

**Can I use it for non-German markets?**
Yes. Language defaults to English. The German-specific logic in `message.py` (formal address, DACH-calibrated copy) is opt-in via `--language de`. Discovery and research work for any city or region worldwide.

**How much does the Gemini API cost for a full pipeline run?**
A typical pipeline run (10 leads: discover + research + message) uses roughly 30-50 API calls with ~2K tokens each. At Gemini 2.0 Flash pricing (~$0.075/1M input tokens), that's under $0.01. Full analytics + content pipeline adds more, but total cost per lead is typically $0.001-$0.01.

**Can I add custom ICP profiles?**
Yes. Pass `custom_profile={"top_industries": [...], "ideal_size_range": (5, 100), "pain_weight": 1.2}` to `qualify()` or `qualify_batch()`. See `qualify.py` for the full profile schema.

**What is AEO / Answer Engine Optimization?**
AEO is the practice of optimizing your website to appear as a cited source in AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini). Unlike traditional SEO where you target keyword rankings, AEO targets entity recognition: does AI know who you are, what you do, and can it verify your authority? The key signals are Organization schema, sameAs links, AI crawler access (robots.txt), and content structure.

**How does the blog pipeline avoid duplicate content?**
Stage 3 uses character shingle similarity (Jaccard coefficient, shingle size 5) to compare the generated article against existing content from your sitemap. If similarity exceeds 0.65, the article is flagged for review. This catches near-duplicate content before publication.

**Can I connect my own CRM instead of Google Sheets?**
`sync.py` posts to any HTTP endpoint that accepts a JSON array. The Google Apps Script webhook is the default integration, but you can pass any `webhook_url` to `sync_leads()`. Adding Airtable, HubSpot, or Pipedrive adapters is a straightforward contribution — see `sync.py` for the payload format.

**Is there a rate limit on the discovery?**
The `discover()` function makes one Gemini API call per batch (with up to 3 retries). It then validates domains with HEAD requests, which are rate-limited to sequential calls. For large batches (100+ companies), run multiple smaller batches with `existing_domains` deduplication.

**How do I contribute?**
Fork the repo, create a branch, make your changes, and open a PR. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup instructions. The most useful contributions: new ICP profiles, new CRM integrations, additional language support in `message.py`, SERP volume integration in `keywords.py`.
